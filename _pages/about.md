Welcome to my academic portfolio page! I am a Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Victoria, BC, Canada. I am a member of the [Victoria Interactive eXperiences with Information (VIXI) Lab](https://vixi.cs.uvic.ca/). My advisor is [Dr. Miguel A. Nacenta](https://nacenta.com/). I conduct research in Human-Computer Interaction, and I build systems to enhance accessibility to data and information for blind and low-vision people, especially in professional and mixed-visual settings.
