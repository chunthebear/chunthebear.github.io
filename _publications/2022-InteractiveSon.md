Soniﬁcation can provide valuable insights about data but most existing approaches are not designed to be controlled by the user in an interactive fashion. Interactions enable the designer of the soniﬁcation to more rapidly experiment with sound design and allow the soniﬁcation to be modiﬁed in real-time by interacting with various control parameters. In this paper, we describe two case studies of interactive soniﬁcation that utilize publicly available datasets that have been described recently in the International Conference on Auditory Display (ICAD). They are from the health and energy domains: electroencephalogram (EEG) alpha wave data and air pollutant data consisting of nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, carbon monoxide, and ozone. We show how these sonﬁcations can be re-created to support interaction utilizing a general interactive soniﬁcation framework built using ChucK, Unity, and Chunity. In addition to supporting typical soniﬁcation methods that are common in existing soniﬁcation toolkits, our framework introduces novel methods such as supporting discrete events, interleaved playback of multiple data streams for comparison, and using frequency modulation (FM) synthesis in terms of one data attribute modulating another. We also describe how these new functionalities can be used to improve the soniﬁcation experience of the two datasets we have investigated.
